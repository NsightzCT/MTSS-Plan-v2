### Decision Rules for Individual Students

#### Academic Decision Rules
- **Positive Response:** Student has made progress and gap with expected performance is closing
  - **Action:** Continue intervention until goal is met, then fade to less intensive support
- **Questionable Response:** Student is making progress but gap is not closing or closing too slowly
  - **Action:** Increase intensity of current intervention or modify components of intervention
- **Poor Response:** Student is not making progress or falling further behind
  - **Action:** Change intervention or increase to more intensive tier of support

#### Behavioral Decision Rules
- **Positive Response:** Problem behavior is decreasing by at least 50% from baseline
  - **Action:** Continue intervention until goal is met, then fade to less intensive support
- **Questionable Response:** Problem behavior is decreasing but by less than 50% from baseline
  - **Action:** Modify intervention components or increase intensity
- **Poor Response:** No change in problem behavior or behavior is worsening
  - **Action:** Conduct new functional assessment and change intervention approach

#### Social-Emotional/Life Skills Decision Rules
- **Positive Response:** Skills are consistently demonstrated across settings
  - **Action:** Continue intervention until goal is met, then fade to less intensive support
- **Questionable Response:** Skills are demonstrated inconsistently or in limited settings
  - **Action:** Modify intervention to address generalization or increase practice opportunities
- **Poor Response:** Skills are not demonstrated or only with maximum support
  - **Action:** Change intervention approach or increase to more intensive support

#### Attendance Decision Rules
- **Positive Response:** Attendance has improved by at least 50% toward goal
  - **Action:** Continue intervention until goal is met, then fade to less intensive support
- **Questionable Response:** Attendance has improved but by less than 50% toward goal
  - **Action:** Modify intervention to address specific barriers
- **Poor Response:** No improvement in attendance or decline in attendance
  - **Action:** Conduct more intensive assessment of barriers and change intervention approach
